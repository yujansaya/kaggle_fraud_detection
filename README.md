Different ways to detect fraud transactions. In this notebook there are data preprocessing (**Feature Scaling, Over- and Undersampling such as SMOTE and Tomek Links**), ML classification algorithms (**Linear Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost** trees), **Neural Network** and **CNN**. Cost-sensitive learning also has been aplied in order to deal with imbalanced data.
